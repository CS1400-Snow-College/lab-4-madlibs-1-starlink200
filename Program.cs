/**************************************************************************************************
* Madlibs is a game in which you take a story and mix up the word types.
* You collect a bunch of words and then insert them into the story.
*
* For example:
*
* A vacation is when you take a trip to some (adjective) place with your
* (adjective) family. Usually you go to some place that is near a/an (noun) or up on a/an (noun).
*
* You would then ask someone else for two nouns and two adjectives, they would say
* 'mountain' , 'billy goat', 'ugly', and 'gentle'.   You'd insert these into the story becomes:

* A vacation is when you take a trip to some ugly place with your gentle family. Usually you go to
* some place that is near a/an mountain or up on a/an billy goat

* Your job is to build a code that detects a word in parenthesis and asks the user for a word of that
* type. You will print the original story and the new 'mad libbed' story.
